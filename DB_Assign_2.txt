4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
==>*Rows of a table are not stored sequentially.
   *Rows of table are scattered all over database server.

   *We didn't know the row address and actual position of row in memory 
    that's why it is not possible to see the first five rows of a table.
